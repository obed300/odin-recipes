    <h3>Description of Okro Stew</h3>
    <p>Okra is thought to be of African origin, particularly West Africa or Ethiopia, although others 
        believe it has origins within South Asia. Okra, sometimes described as lady fingers, are usually green and pointy. They 
        have highly fibrous flesh that can be so hairy it gives an itchy prick. The leaves of the plant are just as hairy.</p>
